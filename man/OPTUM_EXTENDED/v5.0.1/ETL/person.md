# CDM Table: PERSON

PERSON demographics are sourced from the **MEMBER_DETAIL** table. All
enrollment records in **MEMBER_DETAIL** table have both medical and
pharmacy coverage, but one person may have multiple records if there are
gaps between enrollments. However, one record per person will be stored
in the **PERSON** table.

**Key conventions:**

-   Delete the following members: Gender changed over different
    enrollment period or max(YRDOB) &gt; min(YRDOB) +2
-   **MEMBER_DETAIL** records for each person are sorted in ascending
    order by ELIGEFF and ELIGEND, and then use person demographics in
    the last record.
-   After defining the patient's YEAR_OF_BIRTH, delete individuals
    whose
    -   YEAR_OF_BIRTH &lt;1900 or > CURRENT_YEAR
    -   AND whose YEAR_OF_BIRTH > Min(Year(ELIGEFF)) +1
-   For MONTH_OF_BIRTH, the *OBSERVATION_PERIOD* table will need to
    be generated first. Then, the value can be derived from using
    YEAR_OF_BIRTH and OBSERVATION_PERIOD_START_DATE

-   For Race, utilize the D_RACE_CODE as shown below
