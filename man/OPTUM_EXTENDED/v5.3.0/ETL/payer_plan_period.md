# CDM Table: PAYER_PLAN_PERIOD

For each person, create records that indicate that person's continuous
enrollment for a specific product (defined by BUS and PRODUCT) according
to the **MEMBER_DETAIL** table.

Enrollment entries are consolidated by combining records that indicate
continuous enrollment over a period for a specific payer plan.
Consolidation is done through the following steps:

-   Exclude members not included in *PERSON* table.
-   Use the combination of BUS, ASO, PRODUCT, and CDHP to define
    PAYER_SOURCE_VALUE (see table below).
-   **MEMBER_DETAIL** records for each person are sorted in ascending
    order by ELIGEFF, ELIGEND and PAYER_SOURCE_VALUE.
-   Periods of continuous enrollment are consolidated by combining
    records as long as PAYER_SOURCE_VALUE and PLAN_SOURCE_VALUE do
    not change and the time between the end of one enrollment period and
    the start of the next is 32 days or less (&le;32).

**Key conventions:**

-   The gap between plan periods needs to be 32 days or less (&le;32).
-   Revise ELIGEFF to match the start date of Optum data (05/01/2000).
    Note: Depending on your organization's cut of data will determine
    what start bounds you need to enforce.

`CASE WHEN eligeff < '05/01/2000' THEN '05/01/2000' ELSE eligeff END AS PAYER_PLAN_PERIOD_START_DATE`
