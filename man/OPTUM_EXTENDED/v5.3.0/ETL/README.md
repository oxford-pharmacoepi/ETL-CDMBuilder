### CDM Version = 5.3.1, Clinformatics Version = v7.0
##### Authors: Qianli Ma; Erica Voss, Chris Knoll, Ajit Londhe, Clair Blacketer (Janssen)

#### Changelog

|**Date**|**Comments**|
|:-----:|:-----:|
|2017/01/03|Added changelog. Updated death logic for DOD to use the last day of the month rather than the first. Also, to delete death records occurring after the patient DOB.|
|2017/01/11|Updated to use Clinformatics v7, but without adding all of the new features. Clinformatics v7 removes two variables, AMT_COB_RED, and AMT_COB_SAV, so now we are mapping PAID_BY_COORDINATION_BENEFITS to null in drug_cost, procedure_cost, and device_cost|
|2017/03/15|Modified IP visit logic to collapse potential IP visits on the same day even if there are multiple pat_planids associated.|
|2017/04/11|Upgraded to CDM v5.0.1, which brings changes to the COST tables and POA mapping. Also upgraded to Clinformatics v7 fully, bringing in all 25 DIAG fields. Converted document to Markdown.|
|2017/05/01|Added 25 PROC fields to domain tables and in the code snippets section.|
|2018/07/10|Upgraded CDM version to v5.3.1. Fixed POA mapping to CONDITION_STATUS_CONCEPT_ID.|

## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to describe the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) mapping of the licensed data from Optum Extended SES and Optum Extended DOD into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) V5. Due to usage policy, the Optum ClinFormatics Extended Data Mart (CEDM) has been split into three databases: DOD (Date of Death), Other (Non-Affiliate View), and SES (Socio-Economic Status) â€“ and the data should not be combinded into one CDM. CDM BUILDER will treat building SES and DOD the same for the claims information however DOD has more granularity on location and death while SES include more information on socio-economic status.

## Conventions Used in the Documents

The following conventions are used within this document:

|**Convention**|**Description**|
|--------------|--------------|
|-|Value does not exist|
|[]|Refers to a CDM Domain|
|*Italicized*|Refers to a CDM table|
|**Bold**|Refers to a source table (from Optum Extended SES or DOD, in its native schema)|
|```Code```|Pseudo-code, not to be executed directly|

## Processing Sequence Map

This section describes the processing sequence to build CDM tables from
source data files.

### Step I

Use **MEMBER_DETAIL** table to build *LOCATION*, *PERSON*, *OBSERVATION_PERIOD*, and *PAYER_PLAN_PERIOD* tables:

### Step II

Use **RX_CLAIMS** and **MEDICAL_CLAIMS** tables to build *PROVIDER*
table:

![](images/flowchart_step2.png)

### Step III

Use *OBSERVATION_PERIOD*, *PAYER_PLAN_PERIOD*, *PROVIDER* and **MEDICAL_CLAIMS** tables to build *VISIT_OCCURRENCE*, *CONDITION_OCCURRENCE*, *CONDITION_ERA*, *PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE*,
*COST*, and *DEATH* tables:

### Step IV

Use *OBSERVATION_PERIOD*, *PAYER_PLAN_PERIOD*, *PROVIDER*, *PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE* and **RX_CLAIMS** tables to build *DRUG_EXPOSURE*, *DRUG_ERA*, and *COST* tables:

![](images/flowchart_step4.png)

### Step V

Use *OBSERVATION_PERIOD* and **LAB_RESULTS** tables to build *OBSERVATION* and *MEASUREMENT* tables, and create table shells for *CARE_SITE* table:

### Data Mapping

This section describes how the source data are mapped into the CDM.

The following are a list of conventions used throughout all tables in this ETL:

-   Since our data is already de-identified, we do not need to mask our PERSON_IDs.
-   If a CONCEPT_ID column cannot be mapped to a known code, it should be set to 0.
-   If a non-CONCEPT_ID column cannot be mapped to a known code, it should be set to NULL.
-   Only pull records during observation periods where a person had both medical and pharmacy benefits.
-   ICD diagnosis and procedure codes in the **MED_DIAGNOSIS** and **MED_PROCEDURE** tables have no decimal point, so when mapping to the OMOP Vocabulary, the decimal points need to be removed from the vocabulary in order to map between the source and the vocabulary.
