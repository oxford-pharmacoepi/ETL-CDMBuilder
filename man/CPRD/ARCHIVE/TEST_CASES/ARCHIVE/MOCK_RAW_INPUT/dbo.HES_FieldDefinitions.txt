a new episode begins. Episode numbers increase by 1 for each new episode until the patient 
is discharged (this includes transfers to another NHS trust or primary care trust - ie the first 
episode in the new trust will have epiorder 01). 
If the same patient returns for a different spell in hospital, epiorder is again set to 01. 
Admissions are calculated by counting the number of times epiorder is 01. When studying

For example, if a patient was admitted on 25 March 2005 and was not discharged (or 
transferred to the care of another consultant) until 4 April 2005, there will be a record 
describing the unfinished episode (episode status = 1) in the 2004-05 data, and a separate 
record describing the finished episode (episode status = 3) in the 2005-06 data. 
Because hospital providers are advised not to include clinical data (diagnosis and operation 
codes) in unfinished records, these are normally excluded from analyses. 
Also, if unfinished episodes are included in time series analyses - where data for more than 
one year is involved - there is a danger of counting the same episode twice.`	Episodes and spells	1n		Rules 170 and 180

record describing the finished episode (episode status = 3) in the 2005-06 data. 
Because hospital providers are advised not to include clinical data (diagnosis and operation 
codes) in unfinished records, these are normally excluded from analyses.

Area level. 
The IMD has seven domains, one of which is the Income Deprivation Domain. The Income 
Deprivation Affecting Older People Index is a sub-set of the Income Deprivation Domain. The 
Index contains the percentage of a Super Output Area's population aged 60 and over who are

this Domain is to capture the proportions of the population experiencing income deprivation in 
an area.

1842	Combined grossing factor	gross_b	`This field contains a value, calculated to four decimal places, that combines administrative 
(coverage) grossing (the value contained in data item gross_a) and clinical grossing. Clinical 
grossing compensates for the under counting of diagnoses or operations that occurs where 
cases contain a not known diagnosis code. 
The diagnostic data in a predefined group is analysed to ascertain the proportion of records 
that do not have a valid primary diagnosis. This shortfall in diagnostic coding is used to 
calculate a compensating factor. 
The clinical factor is multiplied by the value in gross_a to produce the combined grossing 
factor, gross_b. The default value for this field is 1.0000. It is overwritten when clinical 
grossing is selected.`	System	7n		Not applicable
