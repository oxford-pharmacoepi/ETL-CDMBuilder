TRUVEN CCAE and MDCR Test Scripts
======================

The XLS file provides information on the test cases generated.  Each PERSON_ID represents one test case.

The mock raw input files contain information in the CCAE and MDCR raw table structures however the data has been created specifically to test components of the CDM_BUILDER and contains no true patient data.  In addition, the SQL scripts that were used to generate the data were also included.    

The BUILDER output files contain the CDM tables that would be generated by CDM_BUILDER.
