*******************************************************************************
* VOCABULARY CHANGE
*******************************************************************************
1) We want to adopt a new Vocab as we learned our last 20170503 had missing 
associations between ingredients and drug clinical concepts.  Drugs
where mapped to a standard concept however if you were leveraging the relationships
between a ingredient and clinical drugs you may have not had a complete map.
https://github.com/OHDSI/Vocabulary-v5.0/issues/136

There were 26 JNJ within the list, however only 14 clinical drugs containing 
ingredients norethindrone or ethinyl estradiol were affected.

These ingredients were impacted the most (>50% of the records were lost):
	ethynodiol,Magnesium Sulfate,dasabuvir,potassium sulfate,Norgestrel,lenvatinib,
	ombitasvir,Methylprednisolone,acamprosate,levomefolate,adalimumab,bismuth subsalicylate,
	linoleate,dienogest,insulin human, rDNA origin,dimethyl fumarate,varenicline,
	iron protein succinylate,ferrous bisglycinate,paritaprevir,cabozantinib,Risedronate,
	formic acid,Azithromycin,Mestranol,peginterferon beta-1a
	
A full list can be found on our internal Epi site.

2) A summary of changes by how they play out in raw data can be found on our internal Epi site.

2A)  Anemia has gone back to the condition domain.
https://github.com/OHDSI/Vocabulary-v5.0/issues/129


2B) 30K concepts changed domain.  The largest impact ones according to CCAE are:

	40766642 Measurement ->	Observation	Are you considering quitting smoking during the next 6 months [PhenX]	
	439777	 Measurement ->	Condition	Anemia	
	40482801 Measurement ->	Condition	Type II diabetes mellitus uncontrolled	
	436659	 Measurement ->	Condition	Iron deficiency anemia	
	434169	 Measurement ->	Condition	Abnormal findings on diagnostic imaging of breast	
	40766928 Measurement ->	Observation	Do you now smoke cigarettes, as of 1 month ago [PhenX]	
	436230	 Measurement ->	Condition	Blood chemistry abnormal	
	443961	 Measurement ->	Condition	Anemia of chronic renal failure	
	320536	 Measurement ->	Condition	Electrocardiogram abnormal	
	3012697	 Measurement ->	Observation	History of Tobacco use	

	
2C) Of the source codes that either got a new mapping or whose mappings were deprecated, the ten to impact CCAE most are:

	SOURCE_CODE	OLD_TARGET_CONCEPT_ID	NEW_TARGET_CONCEPT_ID	CONCEPT_NAME
	77052		2211809			0			Computer-aided detection (computer algorithm analysis of digital image data for lesion detection) with further review for interpretation, with or without digitization of film radiographic images; screening mammography (List separately in addition to code 
	97001		2314262			0			Physical therapy evaluation
	77057		2211814			0			Screening mammography, bilateral (2-view film study of each breast)
	77051		2211808			0			Computer-aided detection (computer algorithm analysis of digital image data for lesion detection) with further review for interpretation, with or without digitization of film radiographic images; diagnostic mammography (List separately in addition to code
	90669		2213447			0			Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, 7 valent, for intramuscular use
	73510		2211473			0			Radiologic examination, hip, unilateral; complete, minimum of 2 views
	97002		2314263			0			Physical therapy re-evaluation
	62311		2110622			0			Injection(s), of diagnostic or therapeutic substance(s) (including anesthetic, antispasmodic, opioid, steroid, other solution), not including neurolytic substances, including needle or catheter placement, includes contrast for localization when performed,
	90645		2213431			0			Hemophilus influenza b vaccine (Hib), HbOC conjugate (4 dose schedule), for intramuscular use

	
2D) Of the source codes that received a new concept mapping when they were previously mapped to zero, the ten to impact CCAE most are:

	CURRENT_LOCATION	SOURCE_CODE	SOURCE_VOCABULARY_ID	SOURCE_CONCEPT_NAME						NEW_TARGET_CONCEPT_ID	NEW_DOMAIN_ID	PERSON_COUNT
	CONDITION_OCCURRENCE	V58.11		ICD9CM			Encounter for antineoplastic chemotherapy			37396891		Observation	4075657
	CONDITION_OCCURRENCE	V15.82		ICD9CM			Personal history of tobacco use					43530634		Observation	2303911
	CONDITION_OCCURRENCE	R20.2		ICD10CM			Paresthesia of skin						4236484			Condition	570788
	CONDITION_OCCURRENCE	V58.1		ICD9CM			Encounter for antineoplastic chemotherapy and immunotherapy	4216752			Procedure	439557
	CONDITION_OCCURRENCE	V58.12		ICD9CM			Encounter for antineoplastic immunotherapy			4274159			Procedure	439381
	CONDITION_OCCURRENCE	H40.013		ICD10CM			Open angle with borderline findings, low risk, bilateral	4109420			Condition	292750
	CONDITION_OCCURRENCE	G60.9		ICD10CM			Hereditary and idiopathic neuropathy, unspecified		375806			Condition	101194
	CONDITION_OCCURRENCE	522.4		ICD9CM			Acute apical periodontitis of pulpal origin			37399393		Condition	86583
	CONDITION_OCCURRENCE	H40.023		ICD10CM			Open angle with borderline findings, high risk, bilateral	4109420			Condition	56743

	
3) GRR Vocabulary (Global Reference Repository (IMS)) was dropped from the Vocab.
Our IMS databases do not use us so the loss of this Vocabulary does not affect 
Janssen.
