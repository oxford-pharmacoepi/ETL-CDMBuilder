* VOCABULARY CHANGE
*******************************************************************************
In this release Janssen will go from OMOP Vocabulary 20161218 to OMOP Vocabulary
20170503.  Here are some points for your consideration in this Vocab change.

1) We noticed 1179 concepts are changing domains:
https://github.com/OHDSI/Vocabulary-v5.0/issues/130

The most notable change is Anemia and concepts related to 
anemia are moving from CONDITION_OCCURRENCE to MEASUREMENT.

2)  There are some ICD9/10 codes that do not have a mapping in this Vocabulary.
https://github.com/OHDSI/Vocabulary-v5.0/issues/88

Here are the top 10 ICD9/10 that are missing concepts (the full list can be 
found in the issue linked above):
SOURCE_CODE	CONCEPT_NAME								VOCABULARY_ID	PERSON_COUNT
739.1		Nonallopathic lesions, cervical region		ICD9CM			3809231
739.3		Nonallopathic lesions, lumbar region		ICD9CM			3424667
739.2		Nonallopathic lesions, thoracic region		ICD9CM			2834185
V15.82		Personal history of tobacco use			ICD9CM			1368536
739.4		Nonallopathic lesions, sacral region		ICD9CM			1291748
739.5		Nonallopathic lesions, pelvic region		ICD9CM			692887
655.83		Other known or suspected fetal abnormality, 
			not elsewhere classified, affecting management 
			of mother, antepartum condition or 
			complication				ICD9CM			480460
V58.11		Encounter for antineoplastic chemotherapy	ICD9CM			358861
R20.2		Paresthesia of skin				ICD10CM			266957
739.6		Nonallopathic lesions, lower extremities	ICD9CM			253889

3) There the top condition source codes that lacked a CONCEPT_ID before but now have a mapping.

SOURCE_CODE	VOCABULARY_ID	SOURCE_CONCEPT_NAME								PERSON_COUNT
585.9		ICD9CM			Chronic kidney disease, unspecified					1210392
571.5		ICD9CM			Cirrhosis of liver without mention of alcohol				1132966
995.2		ICD9CM			Unspecified adverse effect of unspecified drug, 
							medicinal and biological substance			666386
707.12		ICD9CM			Ulcer of calf								237525
526.4		ICD9CM			Inflammatory conditions of jaw						88910
27.36		ICD9CM			Circadian rhythm sleep disorder, 
							shift work type						65251
752.2		ICD9CM			Doubling of uterus							34119
758.7		ICD9CM			Klinefelter's syndrome							32061
692.83		ICD9CM			Dermatitis due to metals						23990
728.1		ICD9CM			Calcification and ossification, unspecified				23277


4)  This is still a problem within this Vocabulary, source code HEP C linked to a
HEP B CONCEPT_ID.
https://github.com/OHDSI/Vocabulary-v5.0/issues/93

5)  Issue remaining with some of the ICD10s in Crohn's & Diverticulosis:
https://github.com/OHDSI/Vocabulary-v5.0/issues/122

6)  The NDC Vocabulary is a date centric vocabulary.  However we have noticed in the
NDC dates provided to OMOP Vocabulary are often a bit more narrow than when the drug
is actually prescribed.  We use a large claims database to help push out the dates 
appropriately which means more NDCs should get mapped to standard concepts.
